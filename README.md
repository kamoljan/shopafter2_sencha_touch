### Facebook integration

The Facebook integration works by checking the user's authentication on the client side using the Facebook JS SDK. If
the user is not logged in, they are presented with a button which forwards them to Facebook to authenticate. Since some
actions must be performed on the server side, we need a valid access token on both the client AND server side.

Luckily, there is a way to create an access token on the server side by reading in a cookie set by Facebook during the
client-side authentication process. When the user returns to our app after logging in to Facebook and authorizing our
app, the cookie will be set and can be exchanged for an access token and stored in the session.  See the `checkSession`
method inside  server-side/facebook.js to see how this works in detail.

### Building

### Going production

The Express framework uses the NODE_ENV environment variable to determine some behaviors related to caching.
If youâ€™re using Express, set a config var with this value:

heroku config:add NODE_ENV=production

Then, if you want to switch back to production:

heroku config:set NODE_ENV=development
